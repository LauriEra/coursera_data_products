## Plotly experimentation

Let us experiment with plotly using the "cars"-dataset added with a random gaussian variable.
Here is the code and the actual plot is on the next slide.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(plotly,warn.conflicts = F)
cars$third <- rnorm(nrow(cars))
cars %>% 
    plot_ly(x=~speed,y=~dist,z=~third,type="scatter3d",
            colors=~dist,mode="markers") 
```

## Plotly plot

cars %>% 
    plot_ly(x=~speed,y=~dist,z=~third,type="scatter3d",colors=~dist,mode="markers") 
```
